# Arrays

(Class Video)[http://youtu.be/sEKczcYeeQA]

## Arrays

Evaluate the following expressions assuming that the following array is set

```ruby
a = [1, 7, 11, 19]
```

- a[1]
- a[1+1]
- a[-1]
- a[18]
- a["0".to_i]


## Make Arrays

Create the following arrays in irb

- create an array with 3 integers
- create an array with with the strings "bob", "alice", "charlie"
- create an array with two booleans and 1 integer

## Access array elements

Given the following array, what is the index of the values given?

```ruby
array = [1, 8, 3, 4, nil, "old", 7.1, true, 4,  nil]
```

- "old"
- 8
- true
- 7.1
- 4
- nil

What is the length of the array?

## Expressions which includes arrays

The operation of indexing an array can be combined with other operations to create an expression. Assume that the following arrays have been defined for you and evaluate the following expressions

```ruby
a = [1,2,3,4,5]
b = ['elephant', 'cat', 'dog', 'tiger', 'camel']
c = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]
d = [true, false, false, true]
```

- c[1]
- b[3]
- a[1 + 1]
- a[-1]
- a[5 / 2]
- b[a[1]]
- c[3] + a[1] < 2
- d[3] and d[0]
- c[10] or d[0]

## Iterating through arrays

We will now combine looping through an array with if statements. This will enable us to check conditions on elements of an array. Predict what will happen in the following code.

```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

a.each do |element|
  puts element
end
```

```ruby
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

a.each do |element|
  # remember that % is modulo or remainder
  if element % 2 == 0
    puts element
  end
end
```

```ruby
a = ['dog', 'elephant', 'cat', 'penguin', 'rat', 'quail', 'bat']
a.each do |animal|
  if animal.length <= 3
    puts animal
  end
end
```

```ruby
a = [99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93]
a.each do |bottles|
  puts bottles + " bottles of beer on the wall..."
end
```

## Modifying arrays

Remember that assignments store values in variables. We will now practice how we store things inside arrays. After the following assignments, what does the array a look like?

```ruby
a = [1, 'b', true]
```

- a[0] = 5
- a[2] = false
- a[0 + 1] = 'c'
- a[3] = 10
- a[5] = 66
- a[1] = nil
- a[2] = 3 < 7 and 8 < 3
- a << 3

# Range type

What do the following programs output

```ruby
(1..5).each do |number|
  puts number
end
```

```ruby
a = []
(1..5).each do |number|
  a << number
end
puts a
```
