# More Methods

## Complex methods

Write a method that takes two parameters a and b and prints the max of the two numbers.

```ruby
def max(a, b)
  if a < b
    return b
  else
    return a
  end
end
```

Using this knowledge write code for the following 3 methods:

- A method that takes 3 inputs and prints the largest of the 3
- A method that takes 2 strings and returns the longest string
- A method that takes 3 integers and returns an array with the integers sorted
