# Practice with methods

This practice with methods are intended to give you practice with if statements and loops as well as methods. Some of these methods are already part of a ruby array and you could implement some of these methods by simply calling the existing method. But that would not help you understand the concepts.

# Search an array

Write a method that searches an array for a given item and returns the position of the element in the array. For example:

```ruby
search([1,2,3], 2) # evaluates to 1 because 2 is at position 1
search(["cat", "bat", "rat"], "cat") # evaluates to 0
search([true, false, true, false, true], false) # evalutes to 1
search([], 3) # evaluates to nil
```
