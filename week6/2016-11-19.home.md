## Morse Code

Design a program that asks the user for input and encrypts the string into morse code.

The program should load a file with all the characters and their morse code equivalents.

It should use file data to convert a user string into morse code.

Here is a morse code table

|character| code |
|:-------:|:----:|
| space | *space* |
| comma | --..-- |
| period | .-.-.- |
| ? | ..--.. |
| 0 | ----- |
| 1 | .---- |
| 2 | ..--- |
| 3 | ...-- |
| 4 | ....- |
| 5 | ..... |
| 6 | -.... |
| 7 | --... |
| 8 | ---.. |
| 9 | ----. |
| A | .- |
| B | -... |
| C | -.-. |
| D | -.. |
| E | . |
| F | ..-. |
| G | --. |
| H | .... |
| I | .. |
| J | .--- |
| K | -.- |
| L | .-.. |
| M | -- |
| N | -. |
| O | --- |
| P | .---. |
| Q | --.- |
| R | .-. |
| S | ... |
| T | - |
| U | ..- |
| V | ...- |
| W | .-- |
| X | -..- |
| Y | -.-- |
| Z | --.. |

Sample output

```bash
Morse Code Converter
Type something
> sup # user types sup
... # morse code for S
..- # morse code for U
.---. # morse code for P
> # user types nothing. program closes
```

## Unit conversion program

We need a program that converts the following measurements form English units to metric units.
- Convert inches to centimeters.
- Convert feet to meters.
- Convert miles to kilometers.

Here are the formulas for making these conversions:
- *centimeters* = *inches* x 2.56
- *meters* = *feet* x 2.56
- *kilometers* = *miles* x 2.56

The program should display a menu, like the one below, that allow the user to select the conversion that he or she wants to perform.

```bash
1. Convert inches to centimeters.
2. Convert feet to meters.
3. Convert miles to kilometers.

Enter you selection.
```

Possible output is

<pre>
1. Convert inches to centimeters.
2. Convert feet to meters.
3. Convert miles to kilometers.

Enter you selection.
<b>1 [Enter]</b>
Enter the number of inches.
<b>10 [Enter]</b>
That is equal to 25.4 centimeters.

1. Convert inches to centimeters.
2. Convert feet to meters.
3. Convert miles to kilometers.

Enter you selection.
<b>2 [Enter]</b>
Enter the number of feet.
<b>10 [Enter]</b>
That is equal to 3.048 meters.

1. Convert inches to centimeters.
2. Convert feet to meters.
3. Convert miles to kilometers.

Enter you selection.
<b>3 [Enter]</b>
Enter the number of miles.
<b>10 [Enter]</b>
That is equal to 16.09 kilometers.

1. Convert inches to centimeters.
2. Convert feet to meters.
3. Convert miles to kilometers.

Enter you selection.
<b>4 [Enter]</b>
That is an invalid selection. Enter 1, 2, or 3.
</pre>

You will have to use loops and methods to keep this code readable and easy to understand.

## Rocket launch countdown

Write a program that counts down a rocket launch!

### Normal mode

Write a program that gets an integer from the user and begins a rocket launch countdown
Try to replicate one of these.
[VIDEO](https://youtu.be/OnoNITE-CLc?t=1m)
[ANOTHER ONE](https://youtu.be/wCy401hkXuk)
[FAVORITE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V9TCD0TTtk)

The output should look something like this

```bash
Seconds before countdown: 24 # user types 24
20
15
12
11
10
9
iGNITION SEQUENCE START
6
5
4
3
2
1
ALL ENGINES RUNNING
LIFTOFF
```

As you can see. We count down by 5's until we get to 12. Then we start counting by 1's. The program than says "ignition sequence start", which takes about 3 seconds, and we continue counting down. In normal mode, don't worry about the messages actually appearing on the screen 1 or 5 seconds apart. It's ok if it all prints out at the same time.

## Hard mode

Now you can worry about the messages being 1 or 5 seconds apart. Find a way to get the countdown to actually count down in seconds rather than printing everything all at once.

## Nighmare mode

Now rewrite your code so that it is recursive. Remember, a recursive method is a method that calls itself.

For example:

```ruby
def method
  puts "hello world"
  method
end

method
```

When you execute the file, we get

```bash
hello world
hello world
hello world
hello world
hello world
hello world
# continues forever until we get "SystemStackError: stack level too deep"
```
