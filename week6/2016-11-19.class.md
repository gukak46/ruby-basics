# Files

When you run your program. You can build an array or hash of information. But the moment your program stops running. All those variables with information disappear.

The next time you start that program up again you have to start all over again.

## Review

To begin working with a file
```ruby
file = open("file.txt")
```
Maybe save it to a variable
```ruby
file = open("file.txt")
```
You can then get the content of that file
```ruby
file.read
```
Save it to a variable if you'll use it later
```ruby
text = file.read
```
You can also write to files *(more info [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7911669/create-file-in-ruby))*
```ruby
file = open('file.txt', 'w')
file.puts "This is more text"
```
Don't forget to close the file
```ruby
file.close
```
You can load a YAML file and turn it into a hash like
```ruby
require 'yaml'
hash = YAML.load(File.read('data.yml'))
```
You also can turn a hash into YAML
```ruby
hash.to_yaml
```

## Challenge
Write a program that takes input like name and age.

```bash
Name: Bob
Age: 14
Name: Josh
Age: 25
Name:
```
The program should save info into a file. Call it `ages.yml`

Next time the program runs, it should load the info, and keep adding, and save all of that to the file.

## Default value for parameters

You can set default values for the parameters which will be used if method is called without passing required parameters:
```ruby
def my_method(name = "", age = 0)
  # code
end
```

Whenever you call the simple method, you write only the method name as follows:
```ruby
my_method
```
However, when you call a method with parameters, you write the method name along with the parameters, such as:
```ruby
my_method "bob", 30
```
## Keyword arguments

Besides your regular way of writing parameters
```ruby
def my_method(name, age)
```
You can also use symbols for parameters
```ruby
def my_method(name:, age:)
  # name and age variables are now available
end
```
You can also set default values like this
```ruby
def my_method(name: '', age: 0)
```
Now you can call the method like
```ruby
my_method(name: 'bob', age: 30)
```

## Splat operator for variable number of parameters
If you don't know how many parameters your method will receive you can use the splat operator like so
```ruby
def method(*things)
  p things
  p things.class
end

method(1,2,3)

#=> [1, 2, 3]
#=> Array
```

## Mixing and matching the various types of arguments

```ruby
def some_method(a, b=5, *p) # correct
def some_method(a, *p, b=5) # incorrect!!!
```

## Classes

Everything has a class

```bash
irb(main):026:0> 4.class
=> Fixnum
irb(main):027:0> 3.14.class
=> Float
irb(main):028:0> "boi".class
=> String
irb(main):029:0> [1,true,nil].class
=> Array
irb(main):030:0> true.class
=> TrueClass
irb(main):031:0> nil.class
=> NilClass
irb(main):032:0> {key: 'value'}.class
=> Hash
irb(main):033:0> :key.class
=> Symbol
irb(main):034:0>
```

```ruby
BasicObject
  Object
    Numeric
      Float
      Integer
        Fixnum
    String
    Array
    TrueClass
    FalseClass
    NilClass
    Hash
    Symbol
    Regexp
    Range
```
