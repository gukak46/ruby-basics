##  Thoughts & feelings

If you are new to programmer, it can feel frustrating and you feel lost.

- Don't even know where to start
- Trying to put in code what you see in your head
- Working with a lot of data

Things you can do

- practice
- solve smallest possible problem first
- research
- experiment

Being a programmer is like

## Review

## Classes

- What are classes?
  - Blueprints for objects

Everything has a class

```bash
irb(main):026:0> 4.class
=> Fixnum
irb(main):026:0> 4.class.superclass
=> Integer
irb(main):026:0> 4.class.superclass.superclass
=> Numeric
irb(main):026:0> 4.class.superclass.superclass.superclass
=> Object
irb(main):026:0> 4.class.superclass.superclass.superclass.superclass
=> BasicObject
```

## Inheritance and Instances

Here is a little chart of inheritance.

```ruby
BasicObject
  Object
    Numeric
      Float
      Integer
        Fixnum
    String
    Array
    TrueClass
    FalseClass
    NilClass
    Hash
    Symbol
    Regexp
    Range
```

**Each class has their own little methods**

Try running these commands in `irb`

```bash
3.methods
Integer.instance_methods
Fixnum.instance_methods
```

You should see that `3.methods` has more methods than `Integer.instance_methods`. You should also see that `3.methods` have the same exact methods as `Fixnum.instance_methods`

Now run these commands in `irb`

```bash
3.methods - Object.instance_methods
3.methods - Numeric.instace_methods
3.methods - Integer.instance_methods
3.methods - Fixnum.instance_methods
```

You should see that each successive line returns a smaller array. That's because when you run run `3.methods - Object.instance_methods` you are really saying "Give me all the methods except Object instance methods".

When you execute `3.methods - Numeric.instance_methods` you are really saying "Give me all of `3`'s methods except Numeric methods".

When you say `3.methods - Integer.instance_methods` you are really saying "Give me all methods minus Integer methods".

`Object`, `Numeric`, `Integer`, and `Fixnum` all have their own set of methods.

When you say `Fixnum.instance methods` you are really getting Fixnum methods, Integer methods, Numeric methods, and Object methods.

## Writing you own class methods

### Adding to already existing classes aka "Monkey patching"

You can add methods to existing classes by doing something like this

```ruby
class String
  def my_monkey_patch
    "I have hacked into the String class!"
  end
end
```

You can overwrite existing class instance methods like this

```ruby
class String
  def length
    "I have hacked a pre-existing method in the String class!"
  end
end
```

### `self`

What if we want to do something with the instance? Like, take the string, reverse its order and make it all uppercase?

Solution:

```ruby
class String
  def my_monkey_patch
    self.reverse.upcase
  end
end
```

- Math is messages being passed to objects as well!!!
  - `2 + 2.3`
  - Overriding arithmetic operations (e.g. `def +(other) ... end`)

## Challenge

Write the `sum` method for arrays so that

```ruby
[1,2,3].sum # should return 6
```

## Require

```ruby
require "./array.rb"
```
