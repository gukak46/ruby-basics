## Modifying a program

The following program reads information from a file named ages.yml and create a hash from it. The format of the file is called yaml and it is a useful way of representing hashes in a file.

```ruby
require 'yaml'

ages = YAML.load(File.read('ages.yml')) # create the hash
age_counts = Hash.new(0) # we want the default value to be zero

ages.each do |name, age|
  age_counts[age] = age_counts[age] + 1
end

puts age_counts.inspect # display the contents of the hash

ages_count.each do |age, count|
  # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
end
print "The most common age is: "
```

```yaml
Elinor Violet: 16
Marta Chau: 22
Merry Uyeda: 17
Rhiannon Heslop: 23
Doris Pickron: 4
Roger Wax: 18
Vanetta Lentini: 25
Royal Helmers: 99
Olene Mustard: 18
Ha Kammerer: 16
Nathalie Costa: 30
Shaina Corso: 16
Patsy Moroney: 20
Hyun Zinke: 20
Rosalina Sallis: 7
Gina Hagens: 22
Neoma Quashie: 16
Sylvia Middaugh: 12
Kiyoko Griffey: 18
Hung Lauderback: 16
```

- Copy and paste the code into a file called ages.rb
- Copy and paste the yaml data into a file and call it ages.yml
- Run the code and it should output a hash where the keys are the ages and the values are the number of times the age appears

Questions

- Why does count have to be a hash with defaul value of 0? What would happen if it was just a normal hash?
- After we created a hash where the key is the age and the value is the number of times that age appears, we could use that hash to determine the most common age. The way to do this is to iterate through the hash and using a variable to keep track of the most common age and another variable that keeps track of how many times the most common age appears. Write code in order to determine what the most common age is.
