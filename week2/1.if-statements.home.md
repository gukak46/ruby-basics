# Review If statements and arrays

# Absolute Number

Write a program that asks the user for a number and returns the absolute value of the number. For example:

What is your number? 10
Abs of 10 is 10

What is your number? -20
Abs of -20 is 20

Hint: Think about how to check if a number is less than zero with an if statement.

# What to wear
Write a program that asks what the tempetature is outside. If it is greater than 80 output "You should wear shorts." If it is less than 80 but more than 70 output, "Nice day wear something light". If it is less than 70 but more than 40 output "You need a sweater!" If it is less than 40 output "Why don't you stay inside?"

Hints: Remember to convert what you get from the gets command to an integer to be able to compare it to other integers. Use elsif for multiple checks.
