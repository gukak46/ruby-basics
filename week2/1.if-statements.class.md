# If Statements

## Start with a review

What is the output of the following programs:

```ruby
a = 10
a = a + 1
puts a
```

```ruby
a = 1
b = "days"
puts (a + 3).to_s + " " + b
```

```ruby
a = 10
b = 12
puts (a - 3) < (b - 3)
```

This is something you might not have seen before

```ruby
b = 10
c = 11
puts (b + 1) <= (c - 1)
```

## More details on logical expressions and nil

Evaluate the following expressions, the new type that we have incorporated is the nil type. Assume the following varible assignments are made.

```ruby
password = "123"
age = 14
```

- nil.nil?
- !password.nil? and password == '12'
- age.nil? or 17
- nil and 10
- 77 and 18
- 77 or 18
- not 77
- not nil
- false and 33

## Incorporating what we learned into if statements

Write the following programs in a file and before you run them explain what they are doing

```ruby
number = gets.to_i
if number > 10
  puts "Big"
else
  puts "Small"
end
```

```ruby
print "What is your name? "
name = gets.chomp
print "Hello, " + name
if name == 'Bob'
  puts "What a nice name."
end
```

```ruby
number = gets.to_i
if number < 10
  number = number + 1
end
puts number
```


## Arrays

Evaluate the following expressions assuming that the following array is set

```ruby
a = [1, 7, 11, 19]
```

- a[1]
- a[1+1]
- a[-1]
- a[18]
- a["0".to_i]
