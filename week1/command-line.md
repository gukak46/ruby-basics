# Command Line Project

## 1. create files

In the command line create 3 files books.txt, foods.txt and songs.txt. Then open them using the file navigator and add type your 3 favorite books in books.txt, your 3 favorite foods in foods.txt and your favorite songs in songs.txt. Remember to save your files after you modify each file.

Using the cat command display the contents of each of the files in the terminal.

Use google if you don't remember how the commands work. I suggest googling for "touch command" and "cat command".


## Download files

The website [http://www.textfiles.com/etext/FICTION/](http://www.textfiles.com/etext/FICTION/) has several free books. Remember the curl command that we used to download a file from the internet.

```bash
ctdinstructor:~/workspace $ curl www.textfiles.com/etext/FICTION/mobydick -o mobydick.txt
```

The first parameter to the curl command is the url of the file. Replace the url we saw in class with the url of the book you wish to download.
