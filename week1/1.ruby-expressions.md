# Ruby Expressions & Variables - In Class Exercises

- [How to use irb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVpE4YbUz8Q)
- [How to ruby a ruby file](http://youtu.be/V3ynQciE2ag)

In these exercises you will be running irb. irb is a program that provides a prompt for you to enter ruby code. Remember that there is a difference between the terminal and irb. You can't run terminal commands such as *ls* or *cd* in irb, you can only run ruby code.

To start irb type *irb* at the terminal and press enter.
To exit irb, type exit then press enter.

## Integers, Floats & Strings

Evaluate the following expressions by hand, then run them in irb to see if you are right.

1. (1 + 7) - 2 * 5
2. 11 / 2
3. 11.0 / 2
4. (1 + 1.0) / 2
5. "boo" * 3
6. "code"+"the"+'dream'

## Variables

Open irb and write the following assignments in ruby. Note that you are being given instructions in english and you have to think about how to write code in ruby.

1. Assign 7 to the variable a
2. Set the varible to b to the float 2
3. Set the variable c to the string "Bob"

Now that we have stored those values in the varibles evaluate the following expressions. (If you exit irb you will have to set the variables again. Once you exit all the variable assignments disappear)

1. a + 10
2. b * a
3. c * b
4. a / 2
5. "Hello my name is " + c

## Integer & String methods

Remember that integers, floats, and strings have methods. We can think of them as commands that we can give to a specific number or string. A few methods we learned about were:

1. String#length
2. Integer#next
3. Float#round

Evaluate the following expressions

1. "coding is cool!".length
2. 3.next
3. (1 - 1).next
4. (5.1 + 0.7).round
